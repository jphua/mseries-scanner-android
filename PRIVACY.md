# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how the **M-Series Scanner** app handles your data.

## 1. Data Collection
The M-Series Scanner app is designed to be a local-first utility.
- **Fitness Data**: The app receives real-time fitness data (cadence, power, gear, heart rate, etc.) from Keiser M-Series equipment via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
- **No Personal Information**: We do not collect names, email addresses, or any other personally identifiable information (PII).
- **Location Data**: On Android versions 11 and below, the app requires "Fine Location" permissions to perform Bluetooth scanning. This is an Android system requirement for BLE. The app **does not** track your location or store your coordinates.

## 2. Data Storage
- **Local Storage Only**: All workout data recorded during a session is stored temporarily in the app's internal memory.
- **CSV Export**: When you end a session, the app generates a CSV file. This file is stored in your device's protected internal storage and is only accessible to you. You can choose to share this file via the Android Share sheet to third-party apps (like Email, Drive, etc.).

## 3. Data Transmission
- **No Analytics**: This app does not use any analytics or crash reporting tools that send data to a remote server.
- **No Cloud Sync**: There is no cloud backup or sync feature. Your data never leaves your device unless you manually export and share it.

## 4. Third-Party Services
If you choose to share your exported CSV file with another app (e.g., Google Drive, Strava, or Email), that data becomes subject to the privacy policy of that third-party service.

## 5. Contact
Since this is an open-source project, any concerns regarding privacy can be raised as an issue on the project's GitHub repository.
